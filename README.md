Final project for MTM6201
## My project process
The first thing before I started working on my project is to analysis the webpage. I divided each page to 3 sections: header, main and footer. I used containers to wrap each of them. Then what element should I use for each section had been considered. I began my work after the analysing.
## Challenges you faced
It has been quite challege to me since we need to use bootstrap to finish this project. I am not a good learner for this course, so it took me a while to get used to HTML and CSS(some of them still confuse me). Then suddenly we need to use another framework to do the project. 
## How I overcame those challenges
I have been watching online tutorials on how to use bootstrap and other libraries to complete the project. If I can not figure it out by watch tutorials, I will ask my peer for any advice that they could provide.
## What have I learned by creating my web portfolio
I learnt that bootstrap is easier to use when you know how. Like the 3 cards on my homepage, it will take a while if I use grid to do it. But with bootstrap, you only need to copy the html and modify the class, then it will work. Bootstrap saves time.
## Libraries that have been used during the process:s
